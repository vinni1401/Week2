# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java üöÄ

Welcome to **Week 2** of our Java learning journey! This week, we delve into the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java. By understanding and applying these principles, you'll be able to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## üìù Overview

In Week 2, we focus on the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming in Java. The topics covered include:

- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding how to define classes and create objects.
- **Constructors**: Learning how to initialize objects with constructors.
- **Key Java Keywords**: Exploring the use of `this`, `static`, and `final`.
- **Inheritance**: Implementing inheritance to promote code reusability.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data through access modifiers and getter/setter methods.

## üìò Topics Covered

### Day 1: Classes and Objects
- Defining classes and creating objects.
- Understanding instance variables and methods.
- Exploring object references and memory allocation.
